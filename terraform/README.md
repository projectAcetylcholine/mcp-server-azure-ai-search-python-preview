# Azure Resource Provisioning

This guide shows you how to set up the Azure Resources using Terraform

### 1. **Install Terraform**

- If you havenâ€™t installed Terraform yet, install it:
  
  ```bash
        # (on MacOS with Homebrew)

        # Configure connection to the repo
        brew tap hashicorp/tap

        # Install the latest version of Terraform CLi
        brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform

  ```
  or
  [Download Terraform manually](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).

---

### 2. **Authenticate to Azure**

You must be logged into Azure so Terraform can create the resources for you.

Run:

```bash

az login

```
- This will open a browser to authenticate.
- If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, you might also need:
 
  ```bash
  # Display your Azure Subscriptions
  az account list

  # Specify the Azure Subscription you are using for the Automation
  az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"

  # Specify the Tenant ID Subscription in the Environment Variable for Terraform
  export ARM_TENANT_ID="your tenant id"
  export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your-subscription-id"
  ```

### 3. **Initialize Terraform**

Inside the folder where you have your `main.tf`:

```bash

terraform init

```
- This downloads the **Azure Provider** and sets up your working directory.

---

### 4. **(Optional) Review What Terraform Will Do**

See what Terraform *plans* to create:

```bash

terraform plan

```
- It checks your script and shows you exactly what it will create **without** making changes yet.
- Always a good practice before applying.

---

### 5. **Apply Terraform to Create Resources**

Now **provision** the resources:

```bash

terraform apply

```

- Terraform will show you a detailed list of all resources it will create.
- Type **`yes`** when prompted to approve.

ðŸŒŸ After a few minutes, Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search, Storage Account, and Redis Cache will be created in your Azure account!

---

### 6. **Outputs**

If you included the `output` blocks (like I did in the Terraform file earlier), after `apply`, Terraform will print the important connection details:

âœ… Cosmos DB endpoint  
âœ… Storage account blob URL  
âœ… Redis hostname and access key  
âœ… Azure Search keys  

You can copy this and keep them save for later. These will be needed to provision the Confluent Cloud Resources.

### Quick Recap
| Step              | Command                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Authenticate to Azure | `az login` |
| Initialize Terraform | `terraform init` |
| Plan (Preview)         | `terraform plan` |
| Apply (Provision)       | `terraform apply` |

---

### **Destroy the resources when you are done **
If you ever want to delete everything created by the script:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
(Also prompts you for confirmation.)
